# Graph Editor
==Homework - Graph Editor

There is a subsection of mathematics known as Graph Theory (and it has nothing to do with the Graphs of functions that you learned about in high school algebra). The basic topic of conversation is a Graph which consists of a collection of Nodes and a collection of Edges. The picture that you should have in your head is a bunch of dots on a page (those are the nodes) with straight lines connecting some of the dots (those are the edges). The basic idea is that a graph is an abstract representaion of relationships between a bunch of objects. If the nodes are people and the lines represent parent-child relationship then the graph is a genealogy tree. If the nodes are electrical components and the lines are the wires connecting them you have an electrical circuit. Trees, sewer lines, street maps, are all basically Graphs.

What we want to do is to create a Graph Editor. This should let you create, delete, and move nodes on the screen and create and delete the edges that interconnect them.

When the user moves a node, rather obviously all the edges connecting to that node move along with it.

The Model:

Create a class Graph. A Graph object should hold the 1) the list of nodes and 2) the list of edges. The Graph class should also define two internal classes, Node and Edge. The Node should just be the x,y coordinates of where you will draw the node, and an Edge should just be a pair of Nodes, n1 and n2.

The Graph class should contain methods like:

addNode(Node n); delNode(Node n); addEdge(Edge e); delEdge(Edge e);

for convenience you can have a couple alternate signatures as well like

addNode(int x, int y); addEdge(Node n1, Node n2); - these basically are a combo of construction and addition

finally for convenience in the UI include a few more helper routines

dist(Node n, int x, int y) - how far is it from point xy to the given node (to see if a clicked point is near a node) getNode(int x, int y, int bounds) - return the node closest to xy or null if none are within the acceptable bounds getEdge(node n1, node n2) - see if there is an edge between the supplied nodes, return null if not

The UI:

The UI should work like this:

  1. You will maintain the notion of a selected node, you can either have one node selected or not. Visually you will paint the selected node red.
  2. If nothing is selected and you click on empty space, you create a node at the clicked location.
  2. If nothing is selected and you click on a Node, that node becomes the selected node.
  2. If you have a node selected and you click on empty space, that drops the selection.
  2. If a node is selected AND you click on the selected node AND if the selected node is not connected to anything - you should delete the selected node (and technically you also need to null the selection as well - deleting a node really just means removing it from the graph. You don't want to remove a node from the graph, and yet still be hanging onto that "deleted" node over in your "selected" node variable.)
  2. if you had a selected AND and you clicked on some other node, you are indicating that you want to toggle the edge between those two nodes i.e. if no edge existed then create one and if one existed then delete it.

Saying the whole thing in different words: This is a VERY modal UI. (This is generally bad!) The app behaves very differently depending on whether or not there is a node selected.

NO SELECTION: Click empty space to create a node, Click node to make it Selected.

SELECTION: Click empty space to drop selection, Click another node to toggle edge, Click selected node to delete node. Drag Selected node to move it. 

The purpose of this UI is simple, it allows me to create, delete, and relocate(update) nodes and to create and delete edges (whose location is determined by the nodes).

I recommend keeping two classes, Graph which maintains the model and GraphUI that is responsible for all the MouseListening and determination of what sorts of actions you will be able to perform. Later on, we will learn about the MVC architecture, short for Model-View-Controller, and what we are doing is a version of this: We keep the Graph model in one chunk of code - responsible for maintaining the Graph structure and a different class, the UI for maintaining the view and controlling what happens to the Model.

We are not strictly following the MVC architecture, for example we allow the Graph to render itself rather than placing all rendering code in the UI component, but we are mostly following that separation of function.

Have fun.

Oh yes, some words for the wise. (meaning these were mistakes that I made when I tried to do the homework) 

  1. Be careful when you write the function getEdge(n1, n2) - just remember that the nodes in the edge might not be in the same order as the nodes that were passed in as argruments to the function.
  2. VERY IMPORTANT - we should have done this is Paint. Make sure that the very first thing that you do in your paintComponent function is to clear the screen - do this by setting the color to WHITE, then filling a big white rectangle, g.fillRect(0,0,5000,5000); then setting the color back to BLACK.

  Why? Because if you remove something from your model, and then repaint your model to the screen, those parts of the model that you have removed are still up on the screen - true, you didn't repaint them but the user still sees them because they were never actively erased.

  In our paint app we didn't see the problem because we never removed anything - as soon as you are adding and removing nodes and edges, the problem will surface. This can be a tricky bug to understand meaning you will see the problem but it is easy to draw the wrong conclusion, "I clicked on my selected node but it didn't delete - must be something wrong in the delete code" WRONG - the node was being deleted, the problem was that your paint code was not erasing the screen before it repainted so it looked like the node hadn't been deleted. Tricky to understand, but easy to fix, just remember to erase first in your paint code.
