#  Homework

Time for a Monster Homework assignment.

I could have asked you to go buff up the Animal class so that it does just what the Person class does and keeps a Map with a list of all animals by name, but come on, we already created this Named interface. We have the notion of Named things that could be either Persons or Animals - so how about a Map that takes a string (say, either "Mick" or "Smokey,") and gives a list of all the Named things that have that name?

Sweet.

Here is the problem - where do we put that Map? It isn't a bunch of Persons so it doesn't really belong in the Person class, and neither is it an Animal. We can't put it in the Named class because Named is an interface not a class.

How do we deal with an issue like this? Well, one way would be to create a new class, Names, whose only job is to hold some

```java
  public static Map<String,List<Named>> all = new HashMap<String,List<Named>>();
```

Then anyone that needs all the names just grabs Names.all and there they all are.

Now, here is the useful thing that this Names class can do:

Instead of having code over in Person that is checking if there is already a list (and creating one if there isn't) - code that we did NOT want to duplicate over in Animal - instead, we make it the job of the Names class to do all of that checking and creating for us.

We ought to be able to call a single line in the person constructor like this:

```java
  Names.add(first, this);
```

and a single line in the Animal constructor like this:

```java
  Names.add(name, this);
```

And Hey - while we are at it - (can you tell I'm just making this all up on the fly?) why not also put this line in the Animals constructor:

```java
  Names.add(type, this);
```

So in Names, not only can we look up "Mick" and "Smokey" but we could look up "bear" and get all the bears listed. Oh Yeah!!

Well, if we're gonna do that it means that we need a static function in Names called add() that has two arguments: a String name that we will use for the key, and a Named theNamed that we will shove names onto the list.

Do you see why this function that we built in Names needs to be static? Look at the way I called it:

```java
  Names.add(...)
```

I called it by the name of the class. This is a class function, not an object function. I never create a dozen Names objects. I don't have dozens of Maps floating around. There is only one - it is a static variable in a class that will only have static functions. The one that does the work is:

```java
  public static void add(String name, Named theNamed){
    
  }
```

We will also need to test our names list. We could do that by hacking some test code into Hello just as we have been doing, but we are getting to the point where this is not a good idea.

Names is a class with a Map that contains Lists. That is a two-level deep pile of containers, and if anyone is going to grovel over that pile of containers, it should be the Names class and not someone on the outside like Hello. I mean, what if we wanted to change the underlying data structure? What we would prefer is to build a functional interface to the names class, something like:

```java
  Names.show("Smokey");
```

And this function "show" would print out the list of all the Named objects that are on the "Smokey" list. The only real change we're making is where to locate the code that fetches the List out of the Map based on the keyword "Smokey" and then iterates through that list printing the results out. We could locate that code in Hello, and then need to copy it whenever we want to reuse it, or we can clean it up into a function and locate it over in the Names class.

Oh, and while you're at it, clean up that Person code. Rip out byName - we'll be keeping all the list manipulating code over in the Names class now. Just so ya know, what we are doing here goes by the name "refactoring". We used to have list manipulation code scattered here and there. We have decided that it would make mores sense to collect it all over in one place. Refactoring is the business of moving code around to keep it in a more logical place. There is an entire school of programming based on the idea that all you ever really do is continuous development and continuous refactoring. As soon as you see a more logical organization for your code, hack it up into that organization.

I am a big fan of continuous refactorization. Of course, if you can see the right way to do things right from the start, by all means do it that way, but if you are a mere mortal and it takes a while for you to figure out a new and improved way of doing things, no problem; refactor.

So what do you think? Can you do it? Can you build me a Names class with the static 'all' variable, the static 'add' function (which can be called from the Person and the Animal classes,) and the static 'show' function all properly defined?

It's clobberin' time! Have at it!

## Monster Solution
### Names.java

```java
  package hello;
  
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.HashMap;
  import java.util.List;
  import java.util.Map;
  
  public class Names {
    private static Map<String,List<Named>> byName = new HashMap<String,List<Named>>();
  
    public static void add(String name, Named theNamed){
      // include person on the correct byName list
      List<Named> list = byName.get(name); // get the list associated with this first name
      if(list == null){
        list = new ArrayList<Named>(); // a new dude needs new list
        byName.put(name, list); // put the list into the Map
      }
      list.add(theNamed); // add the person onto the correct list
    }
  
    public static void show(String name){
      List<Named> list = byName.get(name); // get the list associated with this first name
      System.out.println("-- dudes associated with the name: " + name + " --");
      System.out.println(); // notice this way to output a blank line!
      for(Named n : list){
        System.out.println(n.name());
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
### Person.java

```java

    private String first;
    private String last;
    private int age;
    private boolean cougar = false;
    private static int COUGAR_CUT_OFF = 20; // snog someone 20 years younger and become a cougar
    public static ArrayList<Person> all = new ArrayList<>();
  
    public Person(String first, String last, int age){
      this.first = first;  // user passes in f, we load it into the slot first
      this.last = last;
      this.age = age;
      all.add(this);
      Names.add(first, this);
    }
  
    public void snogs(Person p){
      System.out.println("Holy smoke, " + this + " just snogged " + p);
      if(!this.cougar && this.age > (p.age + COUGAR_CUT_OFF)){
        this.cougar = true;
        System.out.println("Cougar detected!");
      }
    }
  
    @Override
    public String toString(){
      return last + ", " + first + (cougar ? ", a known cougar,":"");
    }
  
    @Override

      return first + " " + last;
    }
  }
```

### Animal.java

      this.name = name; this.type = type; this.sound = sound;
      Names.add(name, this);
      Names.add(type, this);
    }
  
    @Override
    public String toString(){
      return name + " the " + type + " says, \"" + sound + ".\"";
    }
  
    @Override
    public String name() {
      return name + " the " + type;
    }
  }
```

### Hello.java

```java
  package hello;
  
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  
  public class Hello {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("\nTesting Person");
      Person x = new Person("Mick", "Smith", 19);
      Person y = new Person("Sally", "Jones", 84);
      System.out.println(x);
      System.out.println(y);
      y.snogs(x);
      y.snogs(x);
  
      Animal a = new Animal("Smokey", "bear", "Only you can prevent forest fires");
      System.out.println(a);
  
      Named n  = x;
      System.out.println(n.name());
      n  = a;
      System.out.println(n.name());
