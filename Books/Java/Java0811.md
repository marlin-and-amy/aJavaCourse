# Graphs with Shared Coordinates

Let us look now at a modification to our graph editor.

Suppose we would like to maintain some horizontal or vertical alignment between some of the nodes. If you think about it, what this means is that you'd like to share coordinates between some of the nodes, so for example if Node A has a given x coordinate and Node B has the same x then those two nodes will be vertically aligned.

Is this a terribly complicated change? At first glance it may sound difficult because if you move one node with its coordinates linked to another node then both have to move at the same time to keep in synch. And yes, this would be difficult if you continue to keep the x,y location of the nodes as a pair of integers and are just trying to keep them synchronized. BUT if instead you stop using integers, create a class, Coord, that holds one single integer value, you could now allow two different nodes to have the same Coord object. If you change the one single coord object from say 17 up to 23, then all the nodes that share that coord object have all changed simultaneously. This is a place where the pointer semantics of objects helps us out.

So let's make the first change. Introduce a new inner class to graph that defines Coord

```java
  public static class Coord{
    public int v; // the one shared value
    public Coord(int x){v = x;}
  }
```

and modify the Node class to keep Coords x,y rather than ints x,y.

If you do this your IDE should see that you massively broke everything. x and y are now no longer ints, you can't use them the way you once did, but they are only one step away from being an int. Every place you used to have this.x, it can now become this.x.v - just go through the shared Coord object to get to the actual int value.

You will also need to fix up the Node creation, which used to just stuff the x and y values into the Node, now it must use those x and y values to construct two new Coords and plug those into the Node that you are creating.

If you fix all the references to x and y both in Graph and in GraphUI you should find that you can run the program just fine. Nothing is ACTUALLY being shared yet because you have created NO method for any two nodes to actually share a Coord. But you should have the system working now with coords under the hood and when you drag nodes around they should now be changing the values of Coords instead of just changing a single Nodes integer x and y values.

What we have done so far is change our graph model so that it supports shared coordinates. Now we need to come up with a UI that will allow us to actually share coordinates. The main thing that our UI needs to be able to do is to tell a node (probably the selected node) that it should replace one of its existing coordinates with one that already exists in some other node. And we will likewise want to be able to UnShare i.e. go back to having a private Coord that is not shared with others as well.

The UI that I came up with may not be terribly convenient for the user but it should be adequate to test the idea and it should be fairly easy to program. The notion I had is that it is easy to distinguish if you have clicked within a few pixels of the border, either the top (where the Mouse Y value is close to zero) or the left hand edge (where the Mouse X value is close to zero). Normally if you have a node selected and you click on blank space, it just drops the selection BUT we could instead check if the place you clicked on was close to the border, and if it is, we assume that you are trying to pick up a shared coordinate. I mean, if you are within a couple of pixels from the top, then your mouse y is close to zero but you mouse x could be anything. Cruise through the nodes and find an existing Node that has and x Coord that is close to that Mouse x. Basically you are telling the selected Node to share that x Coord. Similarly a click near the left boarder tells you to go find a shared Y Coord. And last but not least, if you click near 0,0 - instead of looking for a both a shared x and a shared y  (which isn't something you are likely to want) we will go back to having a private coord (we will want to essentially create a new Coords for the selected node, leaving the values right where they were so that the node doesn't hop around. True, this doesn't leave us a way to disconnect a node from a shared x value but leave its shared y value connected - but hey, that is how quick and dirty works. We are experimenting to see if shared coordinates looks good and is worth including, we can always patch up the UI later if it was a good idea.

So the hook that we are going to make is - we find the ONE single line of code in the mouseListener which determined that we should drop the selection (we are only at that line because we have a selected node and clicked on empty space) and we will replace that line with a function call. The function will have the further logic to figure out if we were clicking on a point near the border and if so, do the right thing otherwise drop the selection like we did before. Lets call the function shareCoordsOrDropSelection()

```java
  private void shareCoordsOrDropSelection(MouseEvent e){
    int x = e.getX(); int y = e.getY();
    if(x < Graph.RADIUS && y < Graph.RADIUS){ // both near zero
      UI.actionStopSharing(); // no more shared coordinates         
      return; // and we are all done      
    }       
  
    if(x >= Graph.RADIUS && y >= Graph.RADIUS){  // neither near zero       
      UI.actionDropSelection();         
      return;       
    }       
  
    if(x < Graph.RADIUS){
      UI.actionShareY(y);
    } else {
      UI.actionShareX(x);
    }
  }
```

and you can see that I defined a few new actions that we will need to write, actionStopSharing(), actionShareX(val), actionShareY(val)

Since actionShareX() needs to grovel over the nodes looking for a nearby x coordinate I decided that the work should be done over in the Graph class. I started out to write getXCoord(int) and getYCoord(int) in Graph but they were essentially identical to one another except for which coordinate they fetched out of a node, so I changed my mind and created a single function getCoord(boolean, int) and the boolean is a flag to decide whether to fetch the x or the y coord. I also noticed that finding the closest coord is nearly identical to finding the closest Node so I just copied the code for getNode() and chopped it up slightly to make it into getCoord.

Either try to make the changes yourself or just look at the code that I wrote and check it out. We can now share coordinates.

I don't like the UI the way I built it. You need to be too accurate. You see a node on the screen whose x value you want to match and you try to click up at the top of the screen at roughly that x value. You have no target to aim for. We could just open up the bounds (which I set to Radius) and allow you click on something quite far from the target value - or we could think of some way to present better click targets.
