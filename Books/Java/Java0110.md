## Java 1-10 Getting Starting [&LT;](Java0109.md) [&GT;](Java0201.md)
# Chapter 1 Summary
Let's do a quick review of where we are and what we've seen so far.

We have learned a few Java keywords:

 <b>package</b>, <b>class</b>, <b>public</b>, <b>private</b>, <b>protected</b>, <b>return</b> and <b>static</b> (which we've seen but haven't yet learned.) 

We know that there are a bunch of modifiers that we could use on functions but almost never do (except for <b>static</b>, <b>abstract</b>, and <b>final</b>.)

We have talked about <i>variables</i> which hold data, <i>functions</i> which process the data in the variables, and <i>classes</i> which are a combination of both variables and functions.

We know the rules, both requirements and conventions, for naming classes, variables and functions. And we know some conventions for indenting nested structures.

We basically know how to create the signature line for classes, variables and functions.

We know two idioms in Java:
1. The one single entry point to an entire program is a main function whose signature is:

```java
public static void main(String[] args){}
```
2. You print messages with:

```java
System.out.println("your message here");
```
