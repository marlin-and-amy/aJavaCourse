# Nested Generics

In the last section we added a Map&lt;String,Person&gt; byName that fetched out a single person that had that first name. What if we wanted something different? What if we wanted instead the list of all of the Persons that have that first name?

OK, let's do that.

We will still need a Map, but instead of being a Map&lt;String,Person&gt; it will need to be a Map&lt;String,ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;&gt; - we will be associating the first name String with a list of Persons. And while we are at it, lets stop using that ArrayList as a descriptor - I bet we could do the same thing we did with Maps and declare it as a Map&lt;String,List&lt;Person&gt;&gt; using the abstract term List so that I could decide later that I didn't want to use an ArrayList but maybe a LinkedList instead.

So we change byName to be:

```java
  public static Map<String,List<Person>> = new HashMap<String,List<Person>>();
```

That wasn't too hard. I had to spell out the generics on the right side in the HashMap because NetBeans whined at me. I guess Java can't figure out nested containers without me spelling it out.

The next step which goes into the constructor is just a little trickier. The issue is this: when we construct a new person we can't just shove them into the byName Map anymore-- instead we must fetch out the List that is sitting in the byName Map, shove the Person into that List AND more importantly, if this was the first person with that name, there is NO List already sitting in the Map.

Dealing with this will require a guard, or a condition. We will fetch out the List associated with the name, "Steve" and IF we get a null, well then we need to create an empty list, shove it into the Map and then put Steve into it. The code looks like this:

```java
  List<Person> list = byName.get(first); // get the list associated with this first name
  if(list == null){
    list = new ArrayList<Person>(); // a new dude needs new list
    byName.put(first, list); // put the list into the Map
  }
  list.add(this); // add the person onto the correct list
```

Notice, when we fetched out a list from the Map there was no need to "put it back." We can change what is on the list but, the list remains where it was in the map.

The same is true in the outside world. What I mean is this: If Hello creates a variable "foo" and loads it up with this Map of the Persons:

```java
  Map<String,List<Person>> foo = Person.byName;
```

That variable foo holds the Map. Not some out of date copy of the map, but the Map (it actually has what is called a "pointer" or a "reference" to the Map).

If we change one of those lists over in the Person class by creating a few new people, then that variable foo over in Hello instantly has all those changes. Hello.foo is not some second copy of the Map that sits in the Person class, it IS the same Map that sits in the Person class. This behavior, where there are many references to a single object so they all seem to update instantly is called "pointer semantics". I will have more to say on pointer semantics later.

We can now test this code over in Hello by creating a second dude named "Mick".

```java
  new Person("Mick","Jagger",103);
  System.out.println(Person.byName.get("Mick"));
  System.out.println(Person.byName.get("Steve"));
```

## Person.java 3.2

```java
  package hello;
  
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.HashMap;
  import java.util.List;
  import java.util.Map;
  
  public class Person implements Named{
    private String first;
    private String last;
    private int age;
    private boolean cougar = false;
    private static int COUGAR_CUT_OFF = 20; // snog someone 20 years younger and become a cougar
    public static ArrayList<Person> all = new ArrayList<>();
    public static Map<String,List<Person>> byName = new HashMap<String,List<Person>>();
  
    public Person(String first, String last, int age){
      this.first = first;  // user passes in f, we load it into the slot first
      this.last = last;
      this.age = age;
      all.add(this);
      // include person on the correct byName list
      List<Person> list = byName.get(first); // get the list associated with this first name
      if(list == null){
        list = new ArrayList<Person>(); // a new dude needs new list
        byName.put(first, list); // put the list into the Map
      }
      list.add(this); // add the person onto the correct list
    }
  
    public void snogs(Person p){
      System.out.println("Holy smoke, " + this + " just snogged " + p);
      if(!this.cougar && this.age > (p.age + COUGAR_CUT_OFF)){
        this.cougar = true;
        System.out.println("Cougar detected!");
      }
    }
  
    @Override
    public String toString(){
      return last + ", " + first + (cougar ? ", a known cougar,":"");
    } 
    
    @Override
    public String name() {
      return first + " " + last;
    }
  }
 ```

## Hello.java

```java
  package hello;
  
  import java.util.ArrayList;
  
  public class Hello {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("\nTesting Person");
      Person x = new Person("Mick", "Smith", 19);
      Person y = new Person("Sally", "Jones", 84);
      System.out.println(x);
      System.out.println(y);
      y.snogs(x);
      y.snogs(x);
  
      Animal a = new Animal("Smokey", "bear", "Only you can prevent forest fires");
      System.out.println(a);
  
      Named n  = x;
      System.out.println(n.name());
      n  = a;
      System.out.println(n.name());
  
      ArrayList<Person> b = Person.all;
      for(int i = 0; i<b.size(); i++){
        System.out.println(b.get(i).name());
      }
      System.out.println("--All persons--");
      for(Person p : Person.all){System.out.println(p.name());}
  
      new Person("Mick","Jagger",103);
      System.out.println(Person.byName.get("Mick"));
      System.out.println(Person.byName.get("Steve"));
    }
  }
```
