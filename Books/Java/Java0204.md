When we run our existing program where we have overriden toString we get:

```text
  Testing Person
  dude named: null, null
```

Well, that's better. Still not quite what we wanted, but we never actually gave the person a name or an age so I guess null is reasonable. How do we stuff values into the slots that were created?

Simple. In your Hello class, after you have created the new Person x but before you print him out add these lines:
::I java
  x.first = "Mick";
  x.last = "Smith";
  x.age = 19;

Basically the Person object x, has slots named "first," "last," and "age," and we can load values into them before we print. (And by the way, this is why I made those variables public, so I could stuff values into them from over here in the Hello class - not what I want to do in the long run, but useful here in the short run.)

## Hello 1.1
```java
  package hello;
    
   public class Hello {
    
     public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("\nTesting Person");
       Person x = new Person();
       x.first = "Mick";
       x.last = "Smith";
       x.age = 19;
       System.out.println(x);
     }
   }
```
