# Object Function

We are going to add a function, an object function, a non-static function, to the Person class, snogs():

```java
  public void snogs(Person p){
    System.out.println("Holy smoke, " + this + " just snogged " + p);
  }
```

And then we are going to call that function from over in the Hello class like this:

```java
  y.snogs(x);
```

As you can see, we have used the fact that 'this' referred to the object upon which a function was invoked.

Make those changes and give it a run. You should see something like:

```text
  Testing Person
  Smith, Mick
  Jones, Sally
  Holy smoke, Jones, Sally just snogged Smith, Mick
```

## Person 1.4

```java
  package hello;
  
  public class Person {
    private String first;
    private String last;
    private int age;
  
    public Person(String first, String last, int age){
      this.first = first;  // user passes in f, we load it into the slot first
      this.last = last;
      this.age = age;
    }
  
    public void snogs(Person p){
      System.out.println("Holy smoke, " + this + " just snogged " + p);
    }
  
    @Override
    public String toString(){return last + ", " + first ;}
  }
```

#Hello.java
  
```java
  package hello;
  
  public class Hello {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
      Person x = new Person("Mick", "Smith", 19);
      Person y = new Person("Sally", "Jones", 84);
      System.out.println(x);
      System.out.println(y);
      y.snogs(x);
    }
  }
```
