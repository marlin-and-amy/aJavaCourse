# Random Couples

Well, reading, writing and sorting was all the heavy lifting in our project. There are only a few things that we need to do to finish up the project of being able to generate random short couple  names.

  1.  I want to run the code we have to same MaleNames.txt in sorted from to ShortMale.txt
 
  2.  Similarly convert FemaleNames.txt to ShortFemale.txt
  
  2.  By hand trim those files - remove strange rarely occuring short names and remove long names (like everything 6 or longer)
  
  2.  Save those trimed files as TrimMale.txt and TrimFemale.txt
  
  2.  Write some code to strip off all the numbers at the end so we can save TrimMale.txt as FinalMale.txt which will be names only
  
  2.  Do the same to convert TrimFemale.txt to FinalFemale.txt
  
  2.  Throw out the text processing code from main, because we are done with that
  
  2.  Modify Liz_n_Dick so that it loads the two final files into static variables and provide a static function that can hand out a single couple at random.


So do I need to walk you though all this or can you do this as a homework assignment?

How about I give you some hints and then show you my solution.

Trimming the files. I made the ArrayList lines public in TextLines. I did this because I think of TextLines as a utility whose purpose was to fetch this ArrayList from a file on behalf of someone else, i.e. expect some other class, like Liz_n_Dick to be doing something to that array list. So getting at the lines from over in LnD is easy. It is just t.lines.

We will want to create a new empty array list of strings in main, newList, we will want to loop through the t.lines list grabbing each line one at a time and converting each string to a the initial substring of each string and adding that line to our growing newList. When we are done we will want to write out the newList.

We have seen how we can find where the name portion of the string ends by using the indexOf() function in string.

```java
  int end = k.indexOf(" ");
```

Now you want the substring that runs from 0, the start of the string up to end. The version of substring that I showed you took a single integer and returned everything from that point to the end of the string. The other version of substring take two integers, treats them as two indexes into the string and returns from the first index to the last index.

So something like

```java
  String w = k.substring(0, end);
```

should give you the name. (Does that just give you the Name by itself or does it give you the Name including the space character that you located at end? You look up the documentation and tell me. Or else do the test and see what it gives you. Or you trim the results that you get. Figure it out.)

and now that you have the String w that consists of only the name you append it to the newList you are building

```java
  newList.add(w);
```

And finally, how do you write that new list out? Well, the lines member of you TextLines was made public. You could replace the lines that you read with the newLines

```java
  t.lines = newLines;
```

Then use TextLines.write to save the Final files.

How do we load our static variables in Liz_n_Dick? How about something like:

```java
  private static TextLines males = new TextLines("FinalMale.txt");
```

DRAT! - that doesn't work. The problem: I forgot that the TextLines constructor throws an exception and initializing a static variable happens down in the Java code - there is no place for me to declare that it throws an exception. The proper fix involves rewriting the constructor so that it catches its own exception. We should have done that in the first place. (Throwing exceptions is of course lazy - catching and dealing with them early on is preferred, even if all you intend to do is to print an error message and halt. My Bad!) So before you start your homework. Go into the TextLines constructor, wrap the guts in a try block and for the catch block write:

```java
  } catch (IOException e){
    System.out.println(e.getMessage();) // this prints the "file not found" msg if that was the problem
    System.exit(3); // this bails out of Java entirely. The 3 is a non-zero number to tell the OS that this program did not terminate properly.
  }
```

Of course, once you do that, the constructor no longer throws exceptions so remove the throws clause as well. We should do exactly the same for the write function - detect the IOException as early as possible and bail. Once we do that, we fix Liz_n_Dick - it no longer needs to throw exceptions because it is no longer getting any. Sorry about that.

Do you remember how to create a static random number generator that we can call to extract a random male name and a random female name?

We will need to know the length of the males.lines - Do you know how to find the length of an ArrayList? Look it up - (it's either length() or size())

See if you can put it together from those hints. If not, read my code. Enjoy!
