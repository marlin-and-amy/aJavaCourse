# Finally the game

If you just count the number of threes that the user guessed and the number of threes in the hid value - how do those numbers compare? I hope it is pretty clear that the number that the user got right is the minimum of those two numbers. I mean if the user guessed 2 and there were really 3, then the user had 2 right. On the other hand if the user guessed 3 and there were only 2 once again the user was right on only 2 of them. So we need to be able to compute a minimum. The customary way to do this in Java or C is to use a conditional expression. i.e. to set C to the minimum value of A and B you would write:

```java
  C = (A < B) ? A : B;
```

Or in English, "if A is less than B then select A otherwise select B."

We need to figure out this count for every single digit so we will be looping through the hist in order to complete this count. When we are done with that count we don't actually have a count of cows, because we never looked at the position information. Basically we need to count the bulls first, then do this overcounting of cows and the actual number of cows will be the overcount minus the number of bulls found.

In the code that counts both the bulls and the cows we will be accumulating a number like the number of cows. It turns out that accumulation is such a common task for computers (what was that subtotal?) that there is a shorthand for accumulation. First here is how we increase x by the value y in longhand:

```java
  x = x + y;
```

and here is the short hand.

```java
  x += y;
```

in English, "x becomes what it was plus y" in code, "x plus-equals y"

For your programming convenience, they decided that if they could do this for addition they could also do it for all 4 simple math functions so there is also -= *= and /=

so

```java
  x *= 3;
```

means "triple the value of x"

```java
  x /=2;
```

means "cut x in two (..AND TRUNCATE, just like we always do in integer math)"

So lets just write the countCowsAndBulls code:

```java
  private void countCowsAndBulls(){
    bulls = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){ if(guess.digits[i] == hid.digits[i]){bulls++;}}
    cows = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < RADIX; i++){ cows += (guess.hist[i] < hid.hist[i]) ? guess.hist[i] : hid.hist[i];}
    cows -= bulls;
  }
```

There is one thing that you need to think about in order to write the game code. How big should the hidden random number be? Well it consists of N digits each of which range over the RADIX value. What you need is RADIX ^ N. I mean a random 4 digit base 10 number ranges from 0 to 9999 which is 10 to the 4th minus 1 - so our argument to the rand function should be RADIX to the N. Unfortunately, Java did not define ^ to be the exponentiation operator. In fact they didn't even define integer exponentiation. (Guess they just didn't write enough mastermind games before they hauled off and defined a language!) So what we are going to do is go over to the Math package, haul out their decimal exponentiation function. Get the answer in double precision and then convert the double result back to the integer that we actually need by using a trick knows as "casting" Sounds complicated but It looks like this:

```java
  int k = (int) Math.pow(RADIX, N);
```

pow is the name of the power function in the Math package. The little int in parens is the cast. It sits in front of a value that is of the wrong type (pow returned a double) and converts it if it can into the desired type (int).

The play function should hide a number and then go into a while loop. Basically, while we don't have four bulls, we want to get a guess from the user and call the countCowsAndBulls function. It will just loop until the user solves the puzzle. In my play function, I want to call setDigits() to shove the guesses and the hidden values into their respective Hist objects. But I just realized that although we declared those objects, we never called their constructors to create those objects. Now I could call the constructor in the play routine, but I think I'd rather have them constructed right from the start when the variables we declared in the first place so before we write play go modify the declarations of hid and guess to be:

```java
  private Hist hid = new Hist();
  private Hist guess = new Hist();
```

So with that out of the way here is the play function.

```java
  public void play(){
    int k = (int) Math.pow(RADIX, N); // max size of hidden integer
    hid.setDigits(rand(k));
    bulls = 0; // important - before we start the while make sure the guard is correct!
    score = 0; // inherited from Game - we are keeping score
    while(bulls < N){
      guess.setDigits(user.nextInt(RADIX));
      countCowsAndBulls();
      System.out.println("cows: " + cows + " bulls: " + bulls);
      score++; // every guess costs us a point
    }
    System.out.println("It took you " + score + " guesses.");
  }
```

Lets go check it out.
