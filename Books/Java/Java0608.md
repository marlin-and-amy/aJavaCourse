# Clean Up
==Clean up and Test
There is one last thing that I decided to do on this routine before I declare it finished.

I don't like the fact that the Mastermind play routing is using System.out.println to toss out the strings to the user. What if someday I decide that I want this game to NOT be running in NetBeans with a little virtual teletype showing the System.out window. I could presumably make this whole game run in a window all its own and suddenly System.out wouldn't be the right thing to do.

What is bothering me is that the a specific choice of WHERE the output should go (namely, System.out) is showing up down there in the Mastermind game. I decided that I should hide that detail up in the Game class. Game can know that we are shoving things to System.out but Mastermind will be sheltered.

All I did was write another procedure in Game, named post() that takes a string and shoves it to System.out

```java
  public static void post(String x){System.out.println(x);}
```

And then, every call to System.out that used to be in Mastermind was replaced with a post. For example the line

```java
  System.out.println("cows: " + cows + " bulls: " + bulls);
```

became

```java
  post("cows: " + cows + " bulls: " + bulls);
```

Now my Mastermind game knows that it is writing information out somewhere, it just does not know where it is posting the information.

The final thing to do is to test your program. Unfortunately this means playing games. Oh well, the life of a professional programmer is difficult. I encourage you to see that we did the RADIX calculations all correctly, meaning that you should test that the code still works if you shift to base 4 with only 2 digits. Change N and RADIX and see that all it good.

## Homework

It is a minor thing but I'd like the system to tell me what guess I am working on - meaning that it should prompt me with a line

```text
  1:
```

before I enter my first guess and then

```text
  2:
```

before I enter my second guess and so on. It would also be nice if I could type my guess on the same line that the number is on. Meaning that I don't want it to print out 2:<newline> before I type in my second guess, I only want the 2:

Perhaps you can figure out the difference between <b>System.out.println("2:")</b> and <b>System.out.print("2:")</b> 

Feel free to test you theories using the main routine in Games.

Perhaps there should be a function in Game that lets you prompt the user right before you collect their input.

Perhaps you could call that cool new function from Mastermind.

Perhaps you can figure out the relationship between the current value of score and which guess I am currently working on so that you can supply the correct prompt.

Perhaps this game could tell us what game we are playing.

Enjoy your game!
