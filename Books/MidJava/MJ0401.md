# PaintInk

We could just hack up our old Paint program thus obliterating what we have done so far in this class OR we could write it again from scratch to use more of our architectural components like I.Area and the Ink class that we are about to build. Let us be safe and move on to a new class, PaintInk. Build this class and don't forget to modify your main so that it will create a new PaintInk rather than a new Squares.

PaintInk is going to be our test harness as we build several of the little G components that we need, namely BBox and PL. We will evolve the Ink class at the same time to hold those paths. 

```java
  public class PaintInk extends Window{
    public PaintInk(){
      super("Paint Ink", UC.mainWindowWidth, UC.mainWindowHeight);
    }
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
      G.fillBackground(g, Color.WHITE);
      g.setColor(Color.blue); g.fillRect(100,100,100,100); // the graphics equivalent of "Hello World"
    }
  }
```

Run it to verify that you are properly connected.

Now build the Ink class. Put it in the reaction package. This class is a place holder for what we want to build, but eventually Ink will be a class that will keep a list of ink objects that we can show out to the screen. and we will modify our PaintInk to keep a list and show it to the screen. So here we build both the Ink class and the Ink.List class

### Ink.java

```java
  public class Ink implements I.Show{
    public void show(Graphics g){ // STUB
      g.setColor(Color.red); g.fillRect(100,100,100,100);
    }

    //-------------------------INK.LIST-----------------------------
    public static class List extends ArrayList<Ink> implements I.Show{
      public void show(Graphics g){for(Ink ink : this){ink.show(g);}}
    }
  }
```

Next we modify PaintInk to have a staic variable that is an InkList, a static block to 

```java
  public static Ink.List inkList = new Ink.List();
  static {inkList.add(new Ink());} // add one single ink item so we can test showing a list
```

Finally we modify paint component to show our ink list (and remove the fillRect call which is now over in PaintInk

```java
   public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
    G.fillBackground(g, Color.WHITE);
    inkList.show(g);
  }
```

Should run just fine i.e show a red rect which was our stub for drawing ink.

We will want an Ink.Buffer class to hold the mouse trace as the user draws. That will be an extension of PL, which will our helper in G for polylines so we need to go build that first over in G.

BTW - I am just feeding you code for helpers here. Certainly you CAN just copy and paste it into your class of helpers - BUT unless you read it carefully, you will not know what those helper functions are and why they work. This is ok when you are just shopping for code as you typically do when you import some existing java library class, but if you are trying to learn how to write code you should type these in by hand. You should ask yourself, What should this constructor do? Then write it. Then look at what I did in my constructor. Did we do the same thing? If not, why not? 

When I teach this course in person, of course we write each one of these helper functions by hand. It doesn't take long. They are all short and fairly obvious functions but in class TALK about what each one does as we write it. Here of course, all you have is my notes, that is just what finished code looked like. You should at least look at the function names and parameters and ask yourself, 'What would this function named drawN(Graphics g, int n) do?' If you at least do that you will have some HOPE of remembering the name of the helper function, and what arguments it takes so that you can USE the helpers that YOU (not I) write.

### add to G.java
```java
  public static class PL { // Polyline
    public V[] points;  // we keep an array of points
    public PL(int count){  
      points = new V[count]; // allocate the array 
      for(int i = 0; i < count; i++) { points[i] = new V(0, 0); } // populate it with V objects
    }
    public int size(){return points.length;}
    public void drawN(Graphics g, int n){  // used to draw an initial portion of the full array
      for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        g.drawLine(points[i - 1].x, points[i - 1].y, points[i].x, points[i].y);
      }
    }
    public void draw(Graphics g){drawN(g, points.length);} // draws the whole array.
  }
```

Now with that class we can build our Ink.Buffer class

```java
  public static class Buffer extends G.PL implements I.Show, I.Area{
    public static final int MAX = UC.inkBufferMax; // maximum size of buffer
    public int n; // how many points are actually in the buffer.
    private Buffer(){super(MAX);} // create the PL with MAX points
    public void add(int x, int y){if(n<MAX){points[n].set(x,y); n++;}} // adds new point to buffer
    public void clear(){n = 0;} 
    public void show(Graphics g){this.drawN(g, n);} // Only draw existing points
    public boolean hit(int x, int y){return true;} // any point COULD go into ink
    public void pressed(int x, int y){clear(); add(x,y);} // add first point
    public void dragged(int x, int y){add(x,y);} // add each point as it comes in
    public void released(int x, int y){}
  }
```

Note: we have made our buffer showable. It just draws out the n points that are in the buffer, and it was for this purpose that we put that drawN function into PL.

We have also made the buffer implement I.Area. So when we want an area that collects ink, we can just ask the Ink.BUFFER to do that.

We made our Buffer constructor private. This is almost always an indication that we have a singlton - and that is true. We do not want other classes createing Ink.Buffers. The Ink clas will create only one of these which it will keep as a member. And we might as well make Ink a little more like the Ink that we want - we will make it an extension of PL and we will make the ink constructor copy the points from the BUFFER:

```java 
  public class Ink extends G.PL implements I.Show{
    public static Buffer BUFFER = new Buffer();
    public Ink(){
      super(BUFFER.n); // allocate a PL large enough to hold the n points in the buffer
      for(int i = 0; i<BUFFER.n; i++){points[i] = new G.V(BUFFER.points[i]);}
    }
    public void show(Graphics g){g.setColor(UC.inkColor); this.draw(g);}
```
    
Note: We need to create a second G.V constructor that will make a new V which is a copy of the values in an existing V so that the above for loop will work.

### add to G.V
```java
    public V(V v){x = v.x; y = v.y;} // copy existing V
```
Lastly - We need to fix up our app, PaintInk. We want it to show not only the inkList but also the Ink.BUFFER as we draw into it. And we need to connect the mouse routines in the App to those over in the buffer.

```java
  public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
    G.fillBackground(g, Color.WHITE);
    inkList.show(g);
    g.setColor(Color.RED); Ink.BUFFER.show(g);
  }

  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me){Ink.BUFFER.pressed(me.getX(),me.getY()); repaint();}
  public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me){Ink.BUFFER.dragged(me.getX(),me.getY()); repaint();}
  public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me){inkList.add(new Ink()); repaint();}
```

Yes, that was a lot of changes But here are the two chunks

###  PaintInk.java
```java
  public class PaintInk extends Window{
    public static Ink.List inkList = new Ink.List();
    //static {inkList.add(new Ink());} // add one single ink item so we can test showing a list
    public PaintInk(){super("Paint Ink", UC.mainWindowWidth, UC.mainWindowHeight);}
    
    public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
      G.fillBackground(g, Color.WHITE);
      inkList.show(g);
      g.setColor(Color.RED); Ink.BUFFER.show(g);     
    }
    
    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me){Ink.BUFFER.pressed(me.getX(),me.getY()); repaint();}
    public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me){Ink.BUFFER.dragged(me.getX(),me.getY()); repaint();}
    public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me){inkList.add(new Ink()); repaint();}
  }
```
### Ink.java
```java
  public class Ink extends G.PL implements I.Show{
    public static Buffer BUFFER = new Buffer();
    public Ink(){
      super(BUFFER.n); // create PL big enough to hold the n points in BUFFER
      for(int i = 0; i<BUFFER.n; i++){this.points[i] = new G.V(BUFFER.points[i]);}
    }
    public void show(Graphics g){g.setColor(UC.inkColor); this.draw(g);}
    // ---- List ------
    public static class List extends ArrayList<Ink> implements I.Show{
      public void show(Graphics g){for(Ink ink : this){ink.show(g);}}
    }
    // ---- Buffer ------
    public static class Buffer extends G.PL implements I.Show, I.Area{
      public static final int MAX = UC.inkBufferMax;
      public int n = 0; // tracks how many points are in the buffer.
      private Buffer(){super(MAX);}
      public void add(int x, int y){if(n<MAX){points[n].set(x,y); n++;}} // adds 1 new point to buffer
      public void clear(){n = 0;} // reset the buffer
      public void show(Graphics g){this.drawN(g, n);}// draw the n points as a line.
      public boolean hit(int x, int y){return true;} // any point COULD go into ink
      public void pressed(int x, int y){clear(); add(x,y);} // add first point
      public void dragged(int x, int y){add(x,y);} // add each point as it comes is
      public void released(int x, int y){}
    }
  }
```

## Homework:

As written, the app leaves red ink (the buffer) on the screen when you finish drawing the stroke, while all the other ink is black. What is the minimal change that will make the ink turn black when you mouse up?

Hint: don't try to change the mouse released code. Just change paint component.

Draw a LONG line and see if you can max out our 1000 point ink buffer. (You MUST do this to test the guard that you put into the code to prevent overwriting the buffer!)

Kind of makes you wonder how many points you typically use in a single short stroke. Time to start learning how big typical short gestures are. Add some code so that PaintInk will show you the size of the last Ink stroke that you drew. Just draw a number/message somewhere up toward the upper left corner of the window.
