# Test Recognition
## Day 8


Now that we can train shapes, we should train a few in and see how well the recognizer can distinguish between the multiple shapes in the database. We will just hack up the PaintInk app that we had for that purpose. I was keeping a single prototype list and adding, (either blending or adding any new strokes), to that list. We will maintain that behavior and just add one more step. It will also take the raw ink and attempt to recognize it into a Shape, and if it finds one (remember it can fail and return null) it will print its name to the screen.

So we add a static message to our PaintInk class

```java
  public static String recognized = "";
```

We add a line to paint component

```java
  g.drawString(recognized, 700, 40);
```

We add a line into the mouse Released code up at the top right after we construct the ink.

```java
  Ink ink = new Ink();
  Shape s = Shape.recognize(ink); recognized = "Recog: " + ((s != null)?s.name : "UN-RECOGNIZED");
```

Draw some shapes and see if they match. Worked OK on my machine.

## Additional Clean Up

Looking back at the code I remember now that in the Norm constructor I did something a bit kludgy - I had written a function subSample in Ink.Buffer that returned a PL and then later realized that the constructor of the Norm built a different PL so in the old code I had the Norm constructor copy values from the returned subSampled PL into the actual Norm. This is a defect and easy to fix. We just change the signature of subSample so that instead of returning a new PL, you just pass in a PL that you want modified. Subsample should look like this:

### in Ink.Buffer
```java
    public void subSample(G.PL pl){
      if(n == 0){ return;} // only subsample if there are points in buffer
      int k = pl.points.length;
      for(int i = 0; i<k; i++){pl.points[i].set(this.points[i*(n-1)/(k-1)]);}
    }
```

Then fix the Norm Constructor to now use this new Subsample:

### in Ink.Norm
```java
  public Norm(){
    super(N); // creates the PL 
    BUFFER.subSample(this);
    G.V.T.set(BUFFER.bbox, NCS);
    this.transform();
  }
```

## Refactoring the ShapeTraining

On looking at the code that we just wrote to train shapes I am bothered by how long the mouseRealease method is. This is the way that we wrote it.

```java
  public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me){
    if(curState != ILLEGAL){
      Ink ink = new Ink();
      Shape.Prototype proto;
      if(pList == null){
        Shape s = new Shape(curName); // create the shape
        Shape.DB.put(curName, s);  // add it to the database
        pList = s.prototypes;      // use its prototype list as the current list
      }
      if(pList.bestDist(ink.norm) < UC.noMatchDist){ // we found a match so blend
        proto = Shape.Prototype.List.bestMatch;
        proto.blend(ink.norm);
      }else {
        proto = new Shape.Prototype();
        pList.add(proto); // new Prototype
      }
      fixMsg(); // technically after adding the first prototype we now know this shape so fix the msg
    }
    repaint();
  }
```

It does the job, BUT now that I reflect on it, I want all of that code located in diffferent places. Part of the refactoring is that I don't like the length of this routine. It far exceeds my prefered length for a function, but more importantly, if I move the code from here into various places in the Shape class it will make it possible to do something that I am going to want to do later, namely to train shapes on the fly. It would be NICE if I could write an app that needs a N-W stroke (which isn't in the database), have the app notice that that shape is not in the database and have the app ask the user, "Hey, I need the shape N-W and I don't see it, could you draw me a few examples.." and it trains and saves the new shape. So if I move the training code from the app, ShapeTrainer, into the Shape class, like by adding train functions, it will be easier in the future to at least think about doing on the fly training.

So here is the refactoring notion:

1) Create a new wrapper class for the Shape.DB - add this to Shape:

```java
  public static class Database extends HashMap<String, Shape>{}
```

We will be moving most of the load and save database functions into the Database class so we will both change the type of the DB from HashMap to Database, and call the load function differently

```java
  public static Shape.Database DB = Database.load();
```

2) we take the code that was either adding or blending the ink with a prototype into a "train" function which we put in the class Prototype.List:

```java
  public void train(Ink.Norm norm){
    if(bestDist(norm) < UC.noMatchDist){ // we found a match so blend
      bestMatch.blend(norm);
    }else{
      add(new Shape.Prototype()); // didn't match so add a new one (from Ink.BUFFER)
    }    
  }  
```

3) we add some helper functions to the Database class

```java
  private Database(){super(); String dot = "DOT"; put(dot, new Shape(dot));} // make sure DOT exists
  private Shape forceGet(String name){ // always returns Shape..
    if(!DB.containsKey(name)){DB.put(name, new Shape(name));} //..adds new if necessary
    return DB.get(name);
  }
  public void train(String name, Ink.Norm norm){if(isLegal(name)){forceGet(name).prototypes.train(norm);}}
  public static boolean isLegal(String name){return !name.equals("") && !name.equals("DOT");}
```

4) we modify load and save DB - load for example now returns the Database, and we no longer pass it a file name, we just use it directly from UC. Both of these get placed in the Database class and I have made them private because I don't want the outside world playing with the database.

```java
  private static Database load(){
    Database db = null;
    try{
      System.out.println("attempting DB load..");
      ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(UC.fullPathToShapeDB));
      db = (Database) ois.readObject();
      System.out.println("Successful load: "+ db.keySet());
      ois.close();
    } catch(Exception e) {
      System.out.println("-FAIL- Load DB\n" + e);
      db = new Database(); // use default empty if load failed
    }
    return db;
  }
  private static void save(){
    try{
      ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(UC.fullPathToShapeDB));
      oos.writeObject(DB);
      System.out.println("DB Saved");
      oos.close();
    } catch(Exception e) {
      System.out.println("-FAIL- Save DB\n" + e);
    }
  }
```

5) And since we moved loading and saving into the Database class, we remove those functions from Shape, except for a pass through function that will allow the shape trainer to save. And go modify the code in keypressed to call this function.

```java
  public static void saveShapeDB(){Database.save();}
```
    
6) and now with most of the training being done in the Shape classes, the mouse code in the shape Trainer
simplifies a lot.

```java
  public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me){
    Ink ink = new Ink();
    Shape.DB.train(curName, ink.norm); // this is safe because legal name testing is done in Database
    setState(); // possibly convert previously UNKNOWN to KNOWN
    repaint();
  }  
```

7) and technically we should fix setState() to properly test for legal names using the Shape helper
    curState = (Shape.Database.isLegal(curName)) ? UNKNOWN : ILLEGAL; 

8) Make Trainer a nested class of Shape and simplify the names. (for example once Trainer is in Shape you no longer need to declare variable as Shape.Prototype, you can just declare them as Prototype.)  

Yes - that was a lot of rewriting, but it is a better organization. When and if we do on the fly training, the training code is in the Shape classes and NOT off in some application class that we will not be loading. 

We will not be doing on the fly training quite yet, because while we can train directly in the shape class, we do not yet have anything that allows us to modify the output dynamically to show the user the prompt of what shape they should be drawing, so we will defer that feature for later.
