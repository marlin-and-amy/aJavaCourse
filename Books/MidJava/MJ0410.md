# Constructing Shapes

Where we last left our shape trainer, it was able to update the curName based on key events. We had a setState routine to tell us whether the name was ILLEGAL or UNKNOWN. Now that we have a Shape.DB which we can look at, we can improve that code to now tell us if the shape is already KNOWN. Also we are going to add the pList of prototypes that we know we will be updating.

### add to ShapeTrainer
```java
  public static Shape.Prototype.List pList = new Shape.Prototype.List();
  
  public void setState(){
    curState = (curName.equals("") || curName.equals("DOT")) ? ILLEGAL : UNKNOWN;
    if(curState == UNKNOWN){
      if(Shape.DB.containsKey(curName)){
        curState = KNOWN;
        pList = Shape.DB.get(curName).prototypes;
      }else{
        pList = null;
      }
    }
  } 
```

We have set pList to null if this is an UNKNOWN name. We do that because we call this routine everytime the user types in a letter. They may still be typing. We won't actually know that they are at a name they want us to create until they actually draw a character. We should update paint component so that it will now show both the Ink.BUFFER as they draw the ink and we want to show the prototypes of the shape that they are training.

```java
  public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
    G.fillBackground(g, Color.WHITE);
    g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
    g.drawString(curName, 600,30);
    g.drawString(curState, 700,30);
    g.setColor(Color.RED);
    Ink.BUFFER.show(g);
    if(pList != null){pList.show(g);}
  }  
```

Note: I have guarded the drawing of the pList - becuase it could be null.

Finally we can put in the mouse code. It is very similar to what we had in PaintInk. In fact, I just copied that code and added a few changes, like wrapping the code in a IF block to prevent doing anything if the curName was actually ILLEGAL.   

```java  
  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me){Ink.BUFFER.dn(me.getX(),me.getY()); repaint();}
  public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me){Ink.BUFFER.drag(me.getX(),me.getY()); repaint();}
  public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me){
    if(curState != ILLEGAL){
      Ink ink = new Ink();
      Shape.Prototype proto;
      if(pList == null){
        Shape s = new Shape(curName); // create the shape
        Shape.DB.put(curName, s);  // add it to the database
        pList = s.prototypes;      // use its prototype list as the current list
      }
      if(pList.bestDist(ink.norm) < UC.noMatchDist){ // we found a match so blend
        proto = Shape.Prototype.List.bestMatch;
        proto.blend(ink.norm);
      }else {
        proto = new Shape.Prototype();
        pList.add(proto); // new Prototype
      }
      setState(); // technically after adding the first prototype we now know this shape so fix the msg
    }
    repaint();
  }
```

Check it out. Enter a name and train some strokes. Change the name and notice that it is unknown. Make the first stroke on the new name and notice that the msg changes now that this state is known. Re-Enter the first name and see that it is now known. 

Looks good to me. Time to Serialize.
