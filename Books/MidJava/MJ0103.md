# Window.java
Here is the class that I wrote to do all of the Swing garbage that I must do to have a simple one window application. 

In truth, Swing is a big complicated windowing system all written in java, and I use almost NONE of it. The reason is simple - I am not in the business of writing Swing Applications. 

Swing has all the standard windows stuff for creating Menus, and Dialogs, and Scroll Bars and LayoutManagers and .. I don't use ANY of those. I don't build application, instead I design interfaces. I design things that don't exist. 

Swing programmers use those standard elements to make their application look and behave like standard windows apps. The gesture application which we will build will not look or behave like a standard windows app.

The other reason is that for the purpose of THIS course I am NOT trying to teach you how to create Menus using Swing. There are web tutorials where you can learn to do that if you wish. Instead I want you to be able to build you own menus and buttons and scroll bars so that you can see HOW graphics systems operate.

I will not spend much time explaining how Window.java works here. I will have some comments later but for now, just copy this code, create a java class 'Window' in the graphicLib library and paste this code over it. I will then in the next section tell you how to modify your main routine to use the Window code.

 ## Window.java

```java
  package marlin.graphicsLib;
  
  /*
   *
   * Window is both a JPanel which contains the paint proc and it is
   * an adaptor for the two types of mouse listeners and the key listener.
   * So to build a simple windows app you extend Window and override
   * paintComponent() and any of the listening behaviors like mouseClicked()
   * or keyTyped()
   *
   * It is ONLY intended for simple swing apps that have but a single window
   * frame and a single panel.
   *
