# Ruberband Rects
The adjective "rubberband" is a little archaic these days. It was developed in the days when graphics was transitioning from static drawings on paper to interactive things that you could do with, OMG!, a computer! So a "line" was something drawn on paper, but a "rubberband line" was one that you could stretch and move around on a screen while waving around this weird new device called a "mouse".

We are going to modify the User interface that we just created for our Squares app. Right now you click and get a standard 100 by 100 square. What we are going to do now is first create the 100 by 100 BUT if you don't immediately release the mouse, and instead start dragging, we will use that drag to rubberband the rect that you are creating.

We will want to add a routine in Square to allow a mouse coordinate to resize the VS

```java
  public void resize(int x, int y){if(x>loc.x && y>loc.y){size.set(x - loc.x, y - loc.y);}}
```

And then we need to implement the mouseDragged procedure so that it calls the resizing for the current square. To make it easier to size the current square we add a static Square daSquare, we set it on the mouse down, AND add it to the list, then we modify daSquare in the mouse Dragged routine.

```java
  public static Square daSquare;
  
  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me){
    daSquare = new Square(me.getX(), me.getY());
    daList.add(daSquare);
    repaint();
  }
  
  public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me){
    daSquare.resize(me.getX(), me.getY());
    repaint();
  }
```

Give it a try!
