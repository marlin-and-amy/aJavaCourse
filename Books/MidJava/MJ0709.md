# Flags

We are already adjusting the length of the stems to make room for adding flags onto the end of a stem, so in order to get flags working all we need to do is add some reactions to the Stem class and modify the show routine in Stem to draw out the glyphs used for flags.

We have functions that return us yFirstHead and yBeamEnd in Stem. Which one of those two y values is lowest depends on the direction of the stem. We will add a couple helpers to the stem class.
### add to Stem class
```java
  public int yLo(){return isUp ? yBeamEnd() : yFirstHead();}
  public int yHi(){return isUp ? yFirstHead() : yBeamEnd();}
```

We can use those helpers when we write the reactions to add flags to stems.
### add reactions to the Stem class
```java
  addReaction(new Reaction("E-E"){ // inc FLAG on stem
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      int y = g.vs.yM(), x1 = g.vs.xL(), x2 = g.vs.xH();
      int xS = Stem.this.heads.get(0).time.x;
      if(x1 > xS || x2 < xS){return UC.noBid;}
      int y1 = Stem.this.yLo(), y2 = Stem.this.yHi();
      if(y < y1 || y > y2){return UC.noBid;}
      return Math.abs(y - (y1+y2)/2);
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){
     Stem.this.incFlag();  
    }
  });
  
  addReaction(new Reaction("W-W"){ // DEC FLAG on stem
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      int y = g.vs.yM(), x1 = g.vs.xL(), x2 = g.vs.xH();
      int xS = Stem.this.heads.get(0).time.x;
      if(x1 > xS || x2 < xS){return UC.noBid;}
      int y1 = Stem.this.yLo(), y2 = Stem.this.yHi();
      if(y < y1 || y > y2){return UC.noBid;}
      return Math.abs(y - (y1+y2)/2);
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){
      Stem.this.decFlag();
    }
  });
```

Does it bother you that the bid code is the same for these two functions. It should (well, maybe just a little) How would you fix that?. Extract the bid to a helper.

### Same reaction code refactored
```java
  public static int bidLineCrossesStem(int y, int x1, int x2, Stem stem){
      int xS = stem.heads.get(0).time.x;
      if(x1 > xS || x2 < xS){return UC.noBid;}
      int y1 = stem.yLo(), y2 = stem.yHi();
      if(y < y1 || y > y2){return UC.noBid;}
      return Math.abs(y - (y1+y2)/2);
  }
```

### Reaction code now looks like
```java
  addReaction(new Reaction("E-E"){ // ADD FLAG to stem
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      return bidLineCrossesStem(g.vs.yMid(), g.vs.xLo(), g.vs.xHi(), Stem.this);
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){
     Stem.this.incFlag();  
    }
  });
  
  addReaction(new Reaction("W-W"){ // DEC FLAG to rest
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      return bidLineCrossesStem(g.vs.yMid(), g.vs.xLo(), g.vs.xHi(), Stem.this);
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){
      Stem.this.decFlag();
    }
  });
```

Is that refactored code actually better? Not a whole lot. It means that later IF we find ourselves needing to change the bid (because of competition with some other bid code) we will only need to make the change in one place. On the other hand, it means that when we are scrolling our way through the reactions looking at what we are doing, we are now forced to look somewhere else if we want the details. I have not made any effort so far to do this sort of refactoring on reaction code, and I will make no particular effort in the future. I just felt that it would be useful to point out that it is another directions in which you can further explore code reduction/refactoring.  
      
### add code to the Stem show routine    
```java
  if(nFlag > 0){
    if(nFlag == 1){(isUp? Glyph.FLAG1D: Glyph.FLAG1U).showAt(g,h,x,yB);}
    if(nFlag == 2){(isUp? Glyph.FLAG2D: Glyph.FLAG2U).showAt(g,h,x,yB);}
    if(nFlag == 3){(isUp? Glyph.FLAG3D: Glyph.FLAG3U).showAt(g,h,x,yB);}
    if(nFlag == 4){(isUp? Glyph.FLAG4D: Glyph.FLAG4U).showAt(g,h,x,yB);}
  }
```

Note the names of the flags - an up stem has a flag that hangs down. 

### ..Or refactor the above code for showing glyphs..

Perhaps a better way to do the above would be to have some arrays holding the flag glyphs and use nFlag as an index into those arrays. If you want to do it that way, add these to the Glyph class.

```java
  public static Glyph[] upFlags = {FLAG1U, FLAG2U, FLAG3U, FLAG4U};
  public static Glyph[] dnFlags = {FLAG1D, FLAG2D, FLAG3D, FLAG4D};
```

With those two arrays the code for showing flags in Stem show() simplifies to:

```java
      if(nFlag>0){
        // NOTE: flags on an up stem point Down
        (isUp ? Glyph.dnFlags : Glyph.upFlags)[nFlag-1].showAt(g,h,x,yB);
      }
```
