## MidJava 7-14 Music Notes [&LT;](MJ0713.md) [&GT;](MJ0801.md)
# Accid Code

Well the biggest challenge for that homework assignment for me, and possibly for you as well was locating the 5 accidentals in the Sinfonia Font becuase they were NOT spelled out in the Glyph class.

I tried some random numbers,  (wrote a loop to print out ranges), found the 5, and then tried printing them at different distances from my note heads until I found some numbers that I could add to the Glyph class to draw them out. 

### add to Glyph
```java
  public static Glyph NATURAL = new Glyph((char)61511, 16, -2, 5);
  public static Glyph FLAT = new Glyph((char)61512, 16, -2.5, 4);
  public static Glyph SHARP = new Glyph((char)61513, 16, -2.8, 5);
  public static Glyph DFLAT = new Glyph((char)61514, 16, -4, 5);
  public static Glyph DSHARP = new Glyph((char)61515, 16, -2.8, 7);
```

When I defined those Glyph values I did do something that is almost for sure wrong. I used negative x values which means that the glyph lands to the left of the x coordinate that you tell it to print at. This is UNNATURAL for characters, BUT in this case, it allows me to tell the accidental to print at EXACTLY the same x-coordinate that I am using for the note head, and the glyph will be properly spaced to the left of that head. As I say, probably wrong in the long run when I start wanting to stack my accidental vertically with the more complicated algorithm, but it is good enough for now.

With those Glyphs out of the way, the other features I needed in the Head class are fairly straight forward.
   
First we need the new member added to Head so that Heads know their accidental value

### add new members to Head
```java
  public int accid = -1;  // -1 means no accid, 0-4 are the 5 glyphs in Accids
  public static Glyph[] Accids = {Glyph.DFLAT,Glyph.FLAT,Glyph.NATURAL,Glyph.SHARP,Glyph.DSHARP};
```

Head constructor needs the two reactions to raise and lower the accid level

### add reactions to Head    
```java
    addReaction(new Reaction("NE-SE"){
      public int bid(Gesture g){
        int x = g.vs.xM(), y = g.vs.yL();
        int dx = Math.abs(x()+W()/2 - x);
        if(dx>2*W()){return UC.noBid;}
        int dy = Math.abs(y() - y);
        if(dy> 2*staff.H()){return UC.noBid;}
        return dx+dy;
      }
      public void act(Gesture g){Head.this.incAccid();}
    });

    addReaction(new Reaction("SE-NE"){
      public int bid(Gesture g){
        int x = g.vs.xM(), y = g.vs.yH();
        int dx = Math.abs(x()+W()/2 - x);
        if(dx>2*W()){return UC.noBid;}
        int dy = Math.abs(y() - y);
        if(dy> 2*staff.H()){return UC.noBid;}
        return dx+dy;
      }
      public void act(Gesture g){Head.this.decAccid();}
    });
```

And we need the two helper functions that do the actual raising and lowering of the values

### add incAccid and decAccid to Head
```java
  public void incAccid(){
    if(accid == 4){accid = -1; return;}
    if(accid == -1){accid = 2;}
    accid++;
  }
  
  public void decAccid(){
    if(accid == 0){accid = -1; return;}
    if(accid == -1){accid = 2;}
    accid--;
  }
```

### add a new block to show() in Head
```java
    if(accid >=0){
      g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      Accids[accid].showAt(g, H, x(), y());
    }
```

If you are at all into Design Patterns and their lingo, this is all classic MVC, The Model was that single integer member of the Head. The View is what we had to do in the show routine to see the changes to the Model. And those two helpers that keep that one number in the proper range are the Controlers.
