# Rests

Now that we have a Duration class we are ready to build rests which are a simple extension to that.

### create Rest class
```java
  public class Rest extends Duration{
    public Staff staff;
    public Time time;
    public int line = 4; // this is the default location of any rest
    
    public Rest(Staff staff, Time time){
      this.staff = staff; this.time = time;
      // eventually we will add reactions here to flag and dot our rests.
    }
```

The show routine is mostly just a collection of calls to show the appropriate Glyph. I do need to calculate the y value for the middle line of the staff where the rest is located. This inclines me to write a Staff routine, yLine(int line), that will tell me the y value associated with a line. And thinking about that I realized that the code I have in the the Head constructor which goes the other direction, taking an x value and rounding it off to a line number SHOULD have been written as a helper in the Staff class as well. Furthermore, we will eventually need that code to work for ledger lines which could be above the top line, this means that we need to bias the code so that it works for small negative numbers as well. 

### Minor Fix - add to Staff
```java
  public int yLine(int n){return yTop() + n*H();}
  public int lineOfY(int y){
    int H = sys.fmt.get(iStaff).H;
    int Bias = 100;  // because integer truncation rounds toward 0 ..
    int top = yTop() - H*Bias;  // .. we move the origin to a number like -100
    return (y-top +H/2)/H - Bias; // .. calculate a big number then remove that Bias
  }
```

### change Head Constructor to call lineOfY
```java
   this.line = staff.lineOfY(y);
```

### add a routine to Rest to return its y value   
```java
  public int y(){return staff.yLine(line);}
```

Now that we have access to a y value for a Rest we can build the show routine that selects the proper glyph to show.   

### add to Rest   
```java
  public void show(Graphics g){
    int H = staff.H(), y = y();
    if(nFlag == -2){Glyph.REST_W.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
    if(nFlag == -1){Glyph.REST_H.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
    if(nFlag == 0){Glyph.REST_Q.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
    if(nFlag == 1){Glyph.REST_1F.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
    if(nFlag == 2){Glyph.REST_2F.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
    if(nFlag == 3){Glyph.REST_3F.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
    if(nFlag == 4){Glyph.REST_4F.showAt(g, H, time.x, y);}
  }
```

## Reactions to add Rests

Next we need a Staff reaction that will allow us to build a Rest. I will add two of them. Since the eighth note looks a bit like a "7" we will use an E-S gesture to draw an eighth rest and we will use a W-S to draw the quarter rest. How about the other rests? You will get to them by unflagging one of these rests that you can directly enter.

### add reactions to Staff
```java
  addReaction(new Reaction("W-S"){ // add Q Rest
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      int x = g.vs.xL(), y = g.vs.yM();
      if(x < Page.PAGE.xMargin.lo || x > Page.PAGE.xMargin.hi){return UC.noBid;}
      int H = Staff.this.H(), top = Staff.this.yTop()-H,  bot = Staff.this.yBot()+H;
      if(y < top || y > bot){return UC.noBid;}
      return 10;
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){
      Time t = Staff.this.sys.getTime(g.vs.xL());
      new Rest(Staff.this, t);
    }
  });
```

the eighth rest reaction looks EXACTLY like that except with the "E-S" stroke and the action must not only create a quarter rest but also set the nFlag of it up to 1.

### modify act of the E-S reaction
```java
  (new Rest(Staff.this, t)).nFlag = 1;
```

At this point, you should be able to enter quarter and eighth rest (assuming of course that you have trained these shapes in your shape database).

## Flagging Rests
Now let us add some reactions to the Rest constructor that will allow us to increment and decrement the flags on the rests.

### add reactions to Rest Constructor
```java
  addReaction(new Reaction("E-E"){ // ADD FLAG to rest
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      int y = g.vs.yM(), x1 = g.vs.xL(), x2 = g.vs.xH(), x = Rest.this.time.x;
      if(x1 > x || x2 < x){return UC.noBid;}
      return Math.abs(y - Rest.this.staff.yLine(4));
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){Rest.this.incFlag();}
  });
```

The W-W reaction looks exactly like that one, but the act routine calls decFlag instead of incFlag

You should now be able to upgrade and downgrade your flags.

## Dotting Rests
And finally we should also add to the constructor a reaction to allow you to Dot a rest. We will NOT require the user to put the dots AFTER the rest (we will allow it, of course). The user should be allowed to just dot on the rest.

### add to Rest constructor
```java
  addReaction(new Reaction("DOT"){
    public int bid(Gesture g){
      int xr = Rest.this.time.x, yr = Rest.this.y();
      int x = g.vs.xM(), y = g.vs.yM();
      if(x<xr || x > xr + 40 || y<yr-40 || y>yr+40){return UC.noBid;}
      return Math.abs(x-xr)+Math.abs(y-yr);
    }
    public void act(Gesture g){Rest.this.cycleDot();}
  });
```

### ugrade Rest show() to display dots
```java
    int off = UC.restAugDotOffset, sp = UC.augDotSpacing;
    for(int i = 0; i<nDot; i++){
      g.fillOval(time.x + off + i*sp, y - 3*H/2, H*2/3, H*2/3);
    }
```

I used an Offset value of 30 and a Spacing value of 12.

That is pretty much what we need from rests. We can create them, flag them up and down, and dot them. If and when we decide that we are not happy with them in the default position we can look into ways to fix that, either by requiring that the user be careful about where they write the E part of their E-S stroke, and using that y as the line value for the rest, or creating "nudge" gestures that will push the rest up or down a line. A third possibility is to have the rest react to notes that are on the same staff at the same time value and nudge themselves away from those notes. This is of course what you would do if you are doing a full computer layout of the music, and we will not be doing any of that that in this course.

Next task is to get stems up and working.
