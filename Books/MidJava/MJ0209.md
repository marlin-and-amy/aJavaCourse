# Areas
For this next section we are going to do a bit of refactoring that will be more useful later on when we get to gesture recognition than it will be right now, but I can already see the need for it in the Squares application.

I hope you noticed the difference between our mouse pressed and dragged routines when we were doing Paint versus doing Squares. In Paint, we did one single thing on mouse down, we drew a new line. As a result both the pressed code and the dragged code were very simple, a line or two to add a point to a growing line. However in Squares, we had to detect whether we had clicked on an existing square or on white space and had two completely different behaviors depending on whether we were dragging an existing square or creating a new one. We had to set a boolean, dragging, in pressed, test it in mouseDragged and suddenly our code ballooned up to half a dozen lines of code.

Noobs and academics just let the code balloon up - I mean come on, if it takes 20 lines to do something just write the 20 lines.

This is not a big problem, yet, but imagine if you wanted to have an app where instead of just two behaviors you needed to do 3 or 5. The code would quickly become unmanagable. When we get to our gesture based music notation editor we will probably have at least 3 different behaviors: 1) we will want to do gestures. These should leave ink on the screen while we are dragging, but as soon as you let up, that gesture gets recognized,and the trace on the screen is removed - it was just there so the user could see what gesture they were making. 2) there will be times when what we draw on the screen is genuine ink - the user is just scribbling something on some part of the score. In that case we will still want ink showing up during the draw just like in the gestures, BUT on release instead of recognizing a gesture we will want to actually save an ink ojbect to leave the ink on the screen. 3) there will be times when we want to drage a handle to adjust some parameter, like resizing something. In those cases we do NOT want to have ink showing up on the screen as we drag things around. 4) We will probably want to have buttons that you can click on to fire up an activity that also should NOT be leaving ink on the screen as you drag them (and they probably shouldn't drag either - typical button activity on a drag is to NOT fire the button on press but to notice if you dragged off the button and to NOT fire it unless you released while still on the button)

For our improved design we will use the following model. The screen will be covered with rectangular Areas. On the first mouse down, we will run that list of areas, find out which one was hit and make that one our current area. That Area will then hold the behavior of how to interact for the initial mousePressed, AND for all the dragged events AND for the final release. So an Area will be something that implements this interface (which you should add to I now).
 
 ```java
  public interface Area{
    public boolean hit(int x, int y);
    public void pressed(int x, int y);
    public void dragged(int x, int y);
    public void released(int x, int y);
  }
```

Once we get to the the music application that list of areas will actually be fairly small. Basically the entire screen will be a single gesture recognition area so that list will often consist of but a single element. However we will then have the option of sprinkling on top of that single gesture area a few small handles or possibly some buttons and thus giving us a screen where we can mostly just do gestures BUT it will let us click on buttons and drag on handles easily.

## Adding Areas to our Squares App

I want to go back to our squares app the way is was before we added all that animation. I suppose I should have saved a copy before I hacked it up, but I didn't. So I am just going to effectively shut off the motion by changing the one line where we assigned random velocity to the squares and set them all to zero velocity and commenting out the mouse release code that was changing the velocity. Suddenly everything stops moving. True, we are still in an animation loop but it sure looks like a static picture.

```java
  //public G.V dv = new G.V(G.rnd(20)-10, G.rnd(20)-10);
  public G.V dv = new G.V(0,0); // stop the motion!
```

In our Squares app we have two behaviors that we want to encode as Areas. The dragging of an existing box becomes one behavior, and since that is triggerd by clicking on the square, we can just make each Square into an Area i.e. class Square will implement I.Area. We will also need another Area to represent the act of creating and rubberbanding a square. Rather than build another Area class to do that I will just create a single square and use an anonymous class to be the Background Area. (I know, this may be new to you, that's OK I will show you how.) Here is what we are going to do in the Squares class:
  
```java
  public static I.Area curArea; // this will be the area that we found on the LIST
  public static Square.List daList = new Square.List(); // we create LIST as an empty list
  public static Square BACKGROUND = new Square(0,0) // this will be our back square BUT FIRST some overrides
    {  public void pressed(int x, int y){daSquare = new Square(x,y); daList.add(daSquare);}
       public void dragged(int x, int y){daSquare.resize(x,y);}
    }; // this BACKGROUND is an anonymous subclass of Square with different pressed and dragged behavior
       // note the syntax. I created a new Square BUT just before the semi-colon I put in a block to 
       // override some functions in this ONE SINGLE OBJECT. So it behaves like any Square BUT this
       // one object has a different pressed and a different dragged routine.
  // Now, we finish initializing that special first BACKGROUND Square and put it FIRST on LIST!
  static{BACKGROUND.c = Color.WHITE; BACKGROUND.size.set(3000,3000); daList.add(BACKGROUND);}
  // next we fix the mousePressed and mouseDragged to reflect the Area style.
  public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me){
    int x = me.getX(); int y = me.getY();
    curArea = daList.hit(x,y); // should always succeed because of BACKGROUND
    curArea.pressed(x,y);
    repaint(); // notice: I repaint here in Squares NOT in each little Area
  }
  public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me){
    curArea.dragged(me.getX(), me.getY());
    repaint(); // notice: I repaint here in Squares NOT in each little Area  
  }
  // and paint component is now trivial
  public void paintComponent(Graphics g){LIST.draw(g);}
```

Here is what we fix in the Square class that updates them to be I.Area:

```java
  public static class Square extends VS implements I.Area{ 
    // Squares already implement hit so we need 3 more routines.
    public void pressed(int x, int y){mouseDelta.set(loc.x - x, loc.y - y);} // calculate drag offset
    public void dragged(int x, int y){loc.set(mouseDelta.x + x, mouseDelta.y + y);}
    public void released(int x, int y){}
```

With these changes in place, Squares looks exactly like it did before we added the animation. You can rubberband new squares and you can drag old squares. 

## Conclusions: 

One of the primary thing that you get from objects is that because objects can have different code attached to them, they can behave differently. As a result different classes of objects can often be used to REMOVE IF statements that are testing which branch of the code you are on and what behavior you need. We did that in this case by effectively creating two I.Area classes, one of them, the default one, is for dragging squares, the other one, which we only needed in one place so we did it anonomously, is for rubberbanding. With these two classes, we were able to eliminate the conditional branching from our mousePressed and mouseDragged routines. We switch to data object to get different behaviors.

Note that we did NOT reduce the amount of lines of code. If anything the class is now longer than it was. It is more complex because we now have extra interfaces and extra classes BUT we have taken a long chunk of code (8 lines or more with conditional branches in our original mousePressed) and mashed it down to just a couple lines.

The benefit is that now we can ACTUALLY READ our mousePressed routine. "Oh, just find the Area that you clicked on, make it current, call its pressed routine, and repaint." AND you can see that it will be easier to extend IF we decide that we need to add yet another mouse behavior, or just 3 or 4 more new mouse behaviors.

The two new classes that we created are each simpler than our original class because now one class (Square) contains ONLY the code for dragging and the other (our single anonymous override) had ONLY the code for rubberbanding. So we still have ALL the code that we did, but it is now wrapped up in classes instaed of being branches of an if statement. This is what you are tyring to achieve with "Separations of Concerns".
