## MidJava 5-2 Reactions [&LT;](MJ0501.md) [&GT;](MJ0503.md)

# Reaction.java
```java
  public abstract class Reaction implements I.React{
    public Shape shape;
    private static Map byShape = new Map();
    public static List initialReactions = new List(); // used by Undo to restart everything.   
    
    public Reaction(String shapeName){
      shape = Shape.DB.get(shapeName);
      if(shape == null){System.out.println("WTF? - Shape.DB don't know about: "+shapeName);}
    }
    
    public static class List extends ArrayList<Reaction>{ }
    public static class Map extends HashMap<Shape, List>{ }
  }
```

As you can see we have two nested classes, wrappers for lists of reactions and for the Map that will take us from a given shape to all the reactions that are looking for that particular shape. We have a single byShape Map and we have made it private. The Reaction class will eventually have a static method, best, that will give you back the winning reaction, if there was one, that was looking for that particular shape which won the bid.

We will finish off that class by working from the bottom up.

First we add a function to the Map class. One of the reasons for the wrapper is so that we can add a routine that you almost always need for this type of Map. The problem is that if you look up a shape that is not currently in the map, it returns a null rather than returning an empty list so that CAN add something to that list.

```java
  public List getList(Shape s){ // always succeeds
    List res = get(s);
    if(res == null){res = new List(); put(s,res);}
    return res;
  }
```

With that function in place we can now place the enabling and disabling functions into the Reaction class

```java
  public void enable(){List list = byShape.getList(shape); if(!list.contains(this)){add(this)}}
  public void disable(){List list = byShape.getList(shape); list.remove(this);}
```

Next we add functions to the List wrapper. We want to wrap the addition and removal of reactions to Reaction lists. Whenever we add a reaction to a mass list, it goes into two places, both the list associated with the mass and the list that is tucked into the byShape Map and the same goes for removal of a single reaction. We also want to be able to systematically go through an entire reaction list, presumably belonging to a Mass, and remove them all when for example we delete the Mass. Put these functions into Reaction.List:

```java
  public void addReaction(Reaction r){add(r); r.enable();}
  public void removeReaction(Reaction r){ remove(r); r.disable();}
  // this next routine is tricky - to avoid concurrent array mods you first remove all from shape map, then clear
  public void clearAll(){for(Reaction r : this){r.disable;} this.clear();}
```

And while we are writing Reaction.List functions we might as well also write the function that runs the list that came from the byShape map looking for the loBid:

```java
  public Reaction loBid(Gesture g){ // can return null - list is Empty or no one wants to bid.
    Reaction res = null; int bestSoFar = UC.noBid; 
    for(Reaction r : this){
      int b = r.bid(g);
      if(b < bestSoFar){bestSoFar = b; res = r;}
    }
    return res;
  }
```

And with that function in place Reaction can now have a single static function that returns the best reaction for ink that was recognized as being a particular shape.

```java
  public static Reaction best(Gesture g){return byShape.getList(g.shape).loBid(g);} // can return null  
```

### Reaction.java
```java
  public abstract class Reaction implements I.React{
    public Shape shape;
    private static Map byShape = new Map();
    
    public static Reaction best(Gesture g){ return byShape.getList(g.shape).loBid(g);} // can return null
    
    public static class List extends ArrayList<Reaction>{
      // adding and removing is done to TWO lists, the one in a Mass and the one in the byShape Map
      public void addReaction(Reaction r){add(r); r.enable;}
      public void removeReaction(Reaction r){ remove(r); r.disable();}
      public void clearAll(){for(Reaction r : this){removeReaction(r);}}
      public Reaction loBid(Gesture g){ // can return null
        Reaction res = null; int bestSoFar = UC.noBid;
        for(Reaction r : this){
          int b = r.bid(g);
          if(b < bestSoFar){bestSoFar = b; res = r;}
        }
        return res;
      }
    }
    public static class Map extends HashMap<Shape, List>{
      public List getList(Shape s){ // always succeeds
        List res = get(s);
        if(res == null){res = new List(); put(s,res);}
        return res;
      }
    }
  } 
```
