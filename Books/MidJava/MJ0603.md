# Page

The primary job of the page is to know its margins. Also in standard music notaion, you will have page after page that all essentially have the same layout, possibly only changing the system format when you come to a new movement of a new section. So the page hangs onto a single sysFmt, the style used for every System on that page. Of course the page also keep a list of all the particular Systems that land on that page.
  
### Create Page.java in the music package
```java
  public class Page extends Mass{
    public static Page PAGE;
  
    public G.LoHi xMargin, yMargin; 
    public Sys.Fmt sysFmt = new Sys.Fmt();
    public int sysGap; // size of spacing between Sys on page
    public ArrayList<Sys> sysList = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public Page(int y){
      super("BACK");
      PAGE = this;
      int MM = 50;
      xMargin = new G.LoHi(MM, UC.mainWindowWidth-MM);      
      yMargin = new G.LoHi(y, UC.mainWindowHeight-MM); 
      // disable initial reaction, create 2 new reactions, add a new sys, add a new staff      
      ...
    }
  }
```

It is always good to move as quickly to the something that you can test, so let's just stub out a show method for our page class,

```java
  public void show(Graphics g){
    g.setColor(Color.RED);
    g.drawLine(0,yMargin.lo,30,yMargin.lo);  // as a stub just show where the top margin is.
  }  
```
  
And next we go into the constructor for the Music application and add in an initial reaction that will create a Page.

```java
  public Music(){
    super("Music1", UC.mainWindowWidth, UC.mainWindowHeight);
    Reaction.initialReactions.addReaction(new Reaction("E-W"){ // create first and only page
      public int bid(Gesture g){return 0;}
      public void act(Gesture g){new Page(g.vs.yM());}
    });
  }
```

Now if you run the Music app just like this, your E-W gesture should create a page, which goes into the layers, and you should see a little red line at the y-value where you drew that E-W stroke.

If you draw a second stroke, and a third... you will see lots of little red lines marking each one, becasue we still have that initial reaction hanging around allowing me to create many Pages each one going into the layers. So I actually want to disable that initial E-W reaction once I have created that first page, so modify the act() function in that intial reaction to disable the reaction after the page is created
.

```java
  public void act(Gesture g){new Page(g.vs.yM()); this.disable();} 
```

With that single change you should find that you can draw one E-W gesture and get the red line but nothing after that will create a second page. You should of course be able to UNDO that first gesture, get back to the blank page and then our initialReaction should be reenabled. (That was one of the lines that we intentionally put into our UNDO code - reenabling the initial reactions.)

We have not finished our Page constructor yet. When we entered that first E-W stroke, we actually wanted to create a System, and a staff (and the underlying Sys.Fmt and Staff.Fmt). So let us create a couple of functions that will do that.

### in Page add
```java
  public void addNewStaffFmtToSysFmt(int y){
    int yOff = y - yMargin.lo;
    int iStaff = sysFmt.size(); // index of the staff we are about to add
    sysFmt.addNew(yOff);  // add to sys.Fmt -- which obsoletes all existing systems
    for(Sys sys :sysList){sys.addNewStaff(iStaff);}
  }
  public void addNewSys(){
    Sys sys = new Sys(this, sysList.size());
    sysList.add(sys);
    for(int i = 0; i<sysFmt.size(); i++){sys.addNewStaff(i);}
  }
```

### update  Page constructor to call the new helpers
```java
  public Page(int y){
    super("BACK");
    int MM = 50;
    xMargin = new G.LoHi(MM, UC.mainWindowWidth-MM);
    yMargin = new G.LoHi(y, UC.mainWindowHeight-MM);
  
    Reaction.initialReactions.get(0).disable();
    addNewStaffFmtToSysFmt(y);
    addNewSys();
    // create 2 new reactions, add a new sys, add a new staff
  }
```

With that code in place we believe that we can create pages which are lists of systems and systems which are lists of staffs and have them all properly linked. Next we must flesh out the Sys and the Staff classes so that they can actually draw themselves out to the screen.
