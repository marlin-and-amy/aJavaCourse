# Bounding Box

## Day 5
In order to recognize Shapes we need to normalize the ink, and this means calculating the size (width and height) of the ink so that we can scale it up or down and translate it to the standard size.

A bounding box for graphics is just 4 numbers, the minX, minY, maxX and maxY for a set of points. We will keep those 4 numbers as two Ranges, a horizontal range and a vertical range. We call those ranges LoHi because a range is just a pair of numbers, a 'lo' one and a 'hi' one. 

We will do one thing tricky in our range class, LoHi. Normally the size of an interval would be just be hi minus lo, however this means that an interval with but a single point in it has zero width. Since scaling involves dividing one range by another, and since division by zero is not allowed we will force the size of our ranges to be at least 1.

LoHi will be the helper class to track ranges and BBox will be the two LoHi values that we need. Notice that a BBox is also type of rectanlge and so we could have made it a VS. We have two different classes here that keep track of rectangles because we have two different behaviors. The primary behavior of a BBox is to grow as you add datapoints. The VS on the other hand is primarily there to hold the values of a rectangle that we can draw on the screen or use to scale something (like a Norm) so that we can render it to the screen. We will include a function in the BBox class that will allow us to convert the BBox, once it has collected all the points in a single mouse stroke, into a VS for rendering purposes

### add to G.java
```java
  public static class LoHi{ // range from lo to hi
    public int lo, hi;
    public LoHi(int min, int max){lo = min; hi = max;}
    public void set(int v){lo = v; hi = v;} // first value into the set
    public void add(int v){if(v<lo){lo=v;} if(v>hi){hi=v;}} // move bounds if necessary
    public int size(){return (hi-lo) > 0 ? hi-lo : 1;}
    public int constrain(int v){if(v<lo){return lo;} else return (v<hi)?v:hi;}
  }
  
  public static class BBox{ // Bounding Box
    LoHi h, v;  // horizontal and vertical ranges.
    public BBox(){h = new LoHi(0,0); v = new LoHi(0,0);}
    public void set(int x, int y){h.set(x); v.set(y);} // sets it to a single point
    public void add(int x, int y){h.add(x); v.add(y);}
    public void add(V v){add(v.x, v.y);}
    public VS getNewVS(){return new VS(h.lo, v.lo, h.hi-h.lo, v.hi-v.lo);}
    public void draw(Graphics g){g.drawRect(h.lo, v.lo, h.hi-h.lo, v.hi-v.lo);}
  }
```

Once we have those helpers written it is an easy manner to fix up our Ink.Buffer so that it has a BBox attached which it clears out on each mouse pressed, and which it updates as the mouse comes in. For the purposes of testing we will modify the Ink.Buffer show routine to draw out the Bounding box as the ink is collected. After you have seen that work you should comment it out.

###  ...Ink.Buffer..
```java
  public int n = 0; // tracks how many points are in the buffer.
  public G.BBox bbox = new G.BBox();
  public void add(int x, int y){if(n<MAX){points[n].set(x,y); n++; bbox.add(x,y);}} // update bbox too
  public void show(Graphics g){this.drawN(g, n); bbox.draw(g);} // show bbox for now to test
  public void pressed(int x, int y){clear(); bbox.set(x,y); add(x,y);} // first point resets bbox
  // we don't need to update dragged because add has been modified to add to the bbox as well.  
```
