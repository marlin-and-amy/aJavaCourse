# aJavaCourse
A course in programming using Java

This course consists of the the notes that were written to accompany an introduction to programming that I, Marlin Eller,  taught for several years at NorthEastern. 

Perhaps someday I can figure out how to let you link directly to the course notes from here. Try this: [Start Java](Books/Java/Java0101.md)

There are two online book here, one in Java that is an intro to Java and the other MidJava that assumes that you already know some java and walks you through a single project that will take about 40 hours to build, simply to give you experience with something that is larger than typical quick small projects that one normally sees in a tutorial. 

This larger project is essentially a demo of a gesture based music notation editor. Here is a youTube video that gives you a view of what the final app looks like [Music Editor Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYHYyzqzjmQ&list=PLjXLpEAWai7HHEKpU3stc4SEPrSYjd5w0&index=3)
